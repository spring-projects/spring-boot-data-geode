> NOTE: You are viewing Samples for Spring Boot for Apache Geode (SBDG) version {version}.

This section contains working examples that show how to use Spring Boot for {geode-name} (SBDG) effectively.

Some examples focus on specific use cases (such as (HTTP) session state caching), while other examples show how SBDG
works under the hood, to give you a better understanding of what is actually happening and how to debug problems with
your Spring Boot {geode-name} applications.
