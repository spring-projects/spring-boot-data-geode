== Apache Geode API Extensions
:geode-name: Apache Geode
:images-dir: ./images

When using the Spring programming model and abstractions, it should not be necessary to use {geode-name}
{apache-geode-javadoc}[APIs] at all -- for example, when using the Spring Cache Abstraction for caching
or the Spring Data Repository abstraction for DAO development. There are many more examples.

For certain use cases, users may require low level access to fine-grained functionally. Spring Boot for {geode-name}'s
`org.springframework.geode:apache-geode-extensions` module and library builds on {geode-name}'s APIs by including
several extensions with enhanced functionality to offer an experience familiar to Spring users inside a Spring context.

TIP: Spring Data for {geode-name} (SDG) also {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#apis[includes] additional extensions to
{geode-name}'s APIs.

[[geode-api-extensions-cacheresolver]]
=== `SimpleCacheResolver`

In some cases, it is necessary to acquire a reference to the cache instance in your application components at runtime.
For example, you might want to create a temporary `Region` on the fly to aggregate data for analysis.

Typically, you already know the type of cache your application is using, since you must declare your application to be
either a client (`ClientCache`) in the {apache-geode-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/chapter_overview.html[client/server topology],
or a {apache-geode-docs}/topologies_and_comm/p2p_configuration/chapter_overview.html[peer member or node] (`Cache`) in
the cluster on startup. This is expressed in configuration when creating the cache instance required to interact with
the {geode-name} data management system. In most cases, your application will be a client. SBDG makes this decision easy,
since it auto-configures a `ClientCache` instance, <<geode-clientcache-applications,by default>>.

In a Spring context, the cache instance created by the framework is a managed bean in the Spring container.
You can inject a reference to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern[_Singleton_] cache bean
into any other managed application component:

.Autowired Cache Reference using Dependency Injection (DI)
====
[source,java]
----
@Service
class CacheMonitoringService {

	@Autowired
    ClientCache clientCache;

    // use the clientCache object reference to monitor the cache as necessary

}
----
====

However, in cases where your application component or class is not managed by Spring and you need a reference to the
cache instance at runtime, SBDG provides the abstract `org.springframework.geode.cache.SimpleCacheResolver` class
(see its {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/cache/SimpleCacheResolver.html[Javadoc]).

.`SimpleCacheResolver` API
====
[source, java ]
----
package org.springframework.geode.cache;

abstract class SimpleCacheResolver {

	<T extends GemFireCache> T require() { }

	<T extends GemFireCache> Optional<T> resolve() { }

	Optional<ClientCache> resolveClientCache() { }

	Optional<Cache> resolvePeerCache() { }

}
----
====

`SimpleCacheResolver` adheres to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID[SOLID OO Principles]. This class is abstract
and extensible so that you can change the algorithm used to resolve client or peer cache instances as well as mock
its methods in unit tests.

Additionally, each method is precise. For example, `resolveClientCache()` resolves a reference to a cache only if
the cache instance is a "`client.`" If a cache exists but is a "`peer`" cache instance, `resolveClientCache()`
returns `Optional.EMPTY`. The behavior of `resolvePeerCache()` is similar.

`require()` returns a non-`Optional` reference to a cache instance and throws an `IllegalStateException` if a cache
is not present.

[[geode-api-extensions-cacheutils]]
=== `CacheUtils`

Under the hood, `SimpleCacheResolver` delegates some of its functions to the
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/util/CacheUtils.html[`CacheUtils`]
abstract utility class, which provides additional, convenient capabilities when you use a cache.

While there are utility methods to determine whether a cache instance (that is, a `GemFireCache`) or Region is a client
or a peer, one of the more useful functions is to extract all the values from a Region.

To extract all the values stored in a Region, call `CacheUtils.collectValues(:Region<?, T>)`. This method returns a
`Collection<T>` that contains all the values stored in the given `Region`. The method is smart and knows how to handle
the `Region` appropriately regardless of whether the `Region` is a client or a peer. This distinction is important,
since client `PROXY` Regions store no values.

WARNING: Caution is advised when you get all values from a Region. While getting filtered reference values from a
non-transactional, reference data only [`REPLICATE`] Region is quite useful, getting all values from a transactional,
[`PARTITION`] Region can prove quite detrimental, especially in production. Getting all values from a Region can be
useful during testing.

[[geode-api-extensions-membership]]
=== `MembershipListenerAdapter` and `MembershipEvent`

Another useful API hidden by {geode-name} is the membership events and listener interface. This API is especially useful
on the server side when your Spring Boot application serves as a peer member of an {geode-name} distributed system.

When a peer member is disconnected from the distributed system, perhaps due to a network failure, the member is forcibly
removed from the cluster. This node immediately enters a reconnecting state, trying to establish a connection back to
the cluster. Once reconnected, the peer member must rebuild all cache objects (`Cache`, `Region` instances, `Index`
instances, `DiskStore` instances, and so on). All previous cache objects are now invalid, and their references are stale.

In a Spring context, this is particularly problematic since most {geode-name} objects are _Singleton_ beans declared in
and managed by the Spring container. Those beans may be injected and used in other framework and application components.
For instance, `Region` instances are injected into SDG's `GemfireTemplate`, Spring Data Repositories and possibly
application-specific data access objects (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object[DAOs]).

If references to those cache objects become stale on a forced disconnect event, there is no way to auto-wire fresh
object references into the dependent application or framework components when the peer member is reconnected, unless the
Spring `ApplicationContext` is "`refreshed`". In fact, there is no way to even know that this event has occurred, since
the {geode-name} `MembershipListener` API and corresponding events are "`internal`".

NOTE: The Spring team explored the idea of creating proxies for all types of cache objects (`Cache`, `Region`, `Index`,
`DiskStore`, `AsyncEventQueue`, `GatewayReceiver`, `GatewaySender`, and others) used by Spring. The proxies would know
how to obtain a fresh reference on a reconnect event. However, this turns out to be more problematic than it is worth.
It is easier to "`refresh`" the Spring `ApplicationContext`, although doing so is no less expensive. Neither way is
ideal. See https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF-921[SGF-921] and https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF-227[SGF-227]
for further details.

In the case where membership events are useful to the Spring Boot application, SBDG provides the following
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/package-frame.html[API]:

* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipListenerAdapter.html[`MembershipListenerAdapter`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipEvent.html[`MembershipEvent`]

The abstract `MembershipListenerAdapter` class implements {geode-name}'s `org.apache.geode.distributed.internal.MembershipListener`
interface to simplify the event handler method signatures by using an appropriate `MembershipEvent` type to encapsulate
the actors in the event.

The abstract `MembershipEvent` class is further subclassed to represent specific membership event types that occur
within the {geode-name} system:

* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/MemberDepartedEvent.html[`MemberDepartedEvent`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/MemberJoinedEvent.html[`MemberJoinedEvent`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/MemberSuspectEvent.html[`MemberSuspectEvent`]
* {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/support/QuorumLostEvent.html[`QuorumLostEvent`]

The API is depicted in the following UML diagram:

image::{images-dir}/membership-api-uml.png[]

The membership event type is further categorized with an appropriate enumerated value,
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipEvent.Type.html[`MembershipEvent.Type`],
as a property of the `MembershipEvent` itself (see {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/MembershipEvent.html#getType--[`getType()`]).

The type hierarchy is useful in `instanceof` expressions, while the `Enum` is useful in `switch` statements.

You can see one particular implementation of the `MembershipListenerAdapter` with the
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/distributed/event/ApplicationContextMembershipListener.html[`ApplicationContextMembershipListener`] class,
which does exactly as we described earlier, handling forced-disconnect/auto-reconnect membership events inside a
Spring container in order to refresh the Spring `ApplicationContext`.

[[geode-api-extensions-pdx]]
=== PDX

{geode-name}'s PDX serialization framework is yet another API that falls short of a complete stack.

For instance, there is no easy or direct way to serialize an object as PDX bytes. It is also not possible to modify an
existing `PdxInstance` by adding or removing fields, since doing so would require a new PDX type. In this case, you must
create a new `PdxInstance` and copy from an existing `PdxInstance`. Unfortunately, the {geode-name} API offers no help
in this regard. It is also not possible to use PDX in a client, local-only mode without a server, since the PDX type
registry is only available and managed on servers in a cluster.

[[geode-api-extensions-pdx-builder]]
==== `PdxInstanceBuilder`

In such cases, SBDG conveniently provides the
{spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/pdx/PdxInstanceBuilder.html[`PdxInstanceBuilder`] class,
appropriately named after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern[Builder software design pattern].
The `PdxInstanceBuilder` also offers a fluent API for constructing `PdxInstances`:

.`PdxInstanceBuilder` API
====
[source,java]
----
class PdxInstanceBuilder {

	PdxInstanceFactory copy(PdxInstance pdx);

	Factory from(Object target);

}
----
====

For example, you could serialize an application domain object as PDX bytes with the following code:

.Serializing an Object to PDX
====
[source,java]
----
@Component
class CustomerSerializer {

	PdxInstance serialize(Customer customer) {

		return PdxInstanceBuilder.create()
            .from(customer)
            .create();
	}
}
----
====

You could then modify the `PdxInstance` by copying from the original:

.Copy `PdxInstance`
====
[source,java]
----
@Component
class CustomerDecorator {

	@Autowired
    CustomerSerializer serializer;

	PdxIntance decorate(Customer customer) {

		PdxInstance pdxCustomer = serializer.serialize(customer);

		return PdxInstanceBuilder.create()
            .copy(pdxCustomer)
            .writeBoolean("vip", isImportant(customer))
            .create();
	}
}
----
====

[[geode-api-extensions-pdx-wrapper]]
==== `PdxInstanceWrapper`

SBDG also provides the {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/pdx/PdxInstanceWrapper.html[`PdxInstanceWrapper`]
class to wrap an existing `PdxInstance` in order to provide more control during the conversion from PDX to JSON and from
JSON back into a POJO. Specifically, the wrapper gives you more control over the configuration of Jackson's
`ObjectMapper`.

The `ObjectMapper` constructed by {geode-name}'s own `PdxInstance` implementation (`PdxInstanceImpl`) is not
configurable, nor was it configured correctly. Unfortunately, since `PdxInstance` is not extensible, the `getObject()`
method fails when converting the JSON generated from PDX back into a POJO for any practical application domain model
type.

The following example wraps an existing `PdxInstance`:

The following example wraps an existing `PdxInstance`:

.Wrapping an existing `PdxInstance`
====
[source,java]
----
PdxInstanceWrapper wrapper = PdxInstanceWrapper.from(pdxInstance);
----
====

For all operations on `PdxInstance` except `getObject()`, the wrapper delegates to the underlying `PdxInstance` method
implementation called by the user.

In addition to the decorated `getObject()` method, the `PdxInstanceWrapper` provides a thorough implementation of the
`toString()` method. The state of the `PdxInstance` is output in a JSON-like `String`.

Finally, the `PdxInstanceWrapper` class adds a `getIdentifier()` method. Rather than put the burden on the user to have
to iterate the field names of the `PdxInstance` to determine whether a field is the identity field and then call
`getField(name)` with the field name to get the ID (value) -- assuming an identity field was marked in the first place
-- the `PdxInstanceWrapper` class provides the `getIdentifier()` method to return the ID of the `PdxInstance` directly.

The `getIdentifier()` method is smart in that it first iterates the fields of the `PdxInstance`, asking each field if it
is the identity field. If no field was marked as the identity field, the algorithm searches for a field named `id`. If
no field with the name `id` exists, the algorithm searches for a metadata field called `@identifier`, which refers to
the field that is the identity field of the `PdxInstance`.

The `@identifier` metadata field is useful in cases where the `PdxInstance` originated from JSON and the application
domain object uses a natural identifier, rather than a surrogate ID, such as `Book.isbn`.

NOTE: {geode-name}'s `JSONFormatter` class is not capable of marking the identity field of a `PdxInstance` originating
from JSON.

WARNING: It is not currently possible to implement the `PdxInstance` interface and store instances of this type as a
value in a Region. {geode-name} assumes all `PdxInstance` objects are an implementation created by {geode-name} itself
(that is, `PdxInstanceImpl`), which has a tight coupling to the PDX type registry. An `Exception` is thrown if you try
to store instances of your own `PdxInstance` implementation.

[[geode-api-extensions-pdx-adapter]]
==== `ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter`

In rare cases, you may need to treat an `Object` as a `PdxInstance`, depending on the context without incurring
the overhead of serializing an `Object` to PDX. For such cases, SBDG offers the `ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter` class.

This might be true when calling a method with a parameter expecting an argument of, or returning an instance of,
type `PdxInstance`, particularly when {geode-name}'s `read-serialized` PDX configuration property is set to `true`
and only an object is available in the current context.

Under the hood, SBDG's `ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter` class uses Spring's
{spring-framework-javadoc}/org/springframework/beans/BeanWrapper.html[`BeanWrapper`] class along with Java's
introspection and reflection functionality to adapt the given `Object` and access it with the full
{apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/pdx/PdxInstance.html[`PdxInstance`] API. This includes the use of the
{apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/pdx/WritablePdxInstance.html[`WritablePdxInstance`] API, obtained from
{apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/pdx/PdxInstance.html#createWriter--[`PdxInstance.createWriter()`], to modify
the underlying `Object` as well.

Like the `PdxInstanceWrapper` class, `ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter` contains special logic to resolve the identity field
and ID of the `PdxInstance`, including consideration for Spring Data's
{spring-data-commons-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/annotation/Id.html[`@Id`] mapping annotation,
which can be introspected in this case, given that the underlying `Object` backing the `PdxInstance` is a POJO.

The `ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter.getObject()` method returns the wrapped `Object` used to construct
the `ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter` and is, therefore, automatically deserializable, as determined by the
{apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/pdx/PdxInstance.html#isDeserializable--[`PdxInstance.isDeseriable()`] method,
which always returns `true`.

You can adapt any `Object` as a `PdxInstance`:

.Adapt an `Object` as a `PdxInstance`
====
[source,java]
----
class OfflineObjectToPdxInstanceConverter {

	@NonNull PdxInstance convert(@NonNull Object target) {
		return ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter.from(target);
	}
}
----
====

Once the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern[Adapter] is created, you can use it to access data
on the underlying `Object`.

Consider the following example of a `Customer` class:

.`Customer` class
====
[source,java]
----
@Region("Customers")
class Customer {

	@Id
    private Long id;

	String name;

	// constructors, getters and setters omitted

}
----
====

Then you can access an instance of `Customer` by using the `PdxInstance` API:

.Accessing an `Object` using the `PdxInstance` API
====
[source,java]
----
class ObjectPdxInstanceAdapterTest {

	@Test
    public void getAndSetObjectProperties() {

		Customer jonDoe = new Customer(1L, "Jon Doe");

		PdxInstance adapter = ObjectPdxInstanceAdapter.from(jonDoe);

		assertThat(jonDoe.getName()).isEqualTo("Jon Doe");
		assertThat(adapter.getField("name")).isEqualTo("Jon Doe");

		adapter.createWriter().setField("name", "Jane Doe");

		assertThat(adapter.getField("name")).isEqualTo("Jane Doe");
		assertThat(jonDoe.getName()).isEqualTo("Jane Doe");
    }
}
----
====

[[geode-api-extensions-security]]
=== Security

For testing purposes, SBDG provides a test implementation of
{geode-name}'s {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/security/SecurityManager.html[`SecurityManager`] interface,
which expects the password to match the username (case-sensitive) when authenticating.

By default, all operations are authorized.

To match the expectations of SBDG's `TestSecurityManager`, SBDG additionally provides a test implementation of
{geode-name}'s {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/security/AuthInitialize.html[`AuthInitialize`] interface,
which supplies matching credentials for both the username and password.
